# Supported Versions

This page documents `.material.bin` file format versions supported by Lazurite - material version number and which Bedrock release and preview versions it applies to.

???info "Older Versions"

    Despite materials prior to `1.21.110` also having a format version number of `22`, they are not supported by latest versions of Lazurite
    because they have a different format despite sharing the same format version. If you wish to work with older `.material.bin` formats,
    older Lazurite versions are required - <https://github.com/veka0/lazurite/releases>
